    <h1>Rivets, Welds, and You</h1>
    <p>High-quality welding work is a necessity where promotion consideration is concerned. One who neglects the smallest detail cannot be put in charge of the whole.</p>
    <blockquote>Assembly is, and will always be, in the details.</blockquote>
    <p>Rivets don't merely give metalwork character - they serve a vital function in joining pieces with strong cohesion. Use liberally where necessary, and always with care.</p>
